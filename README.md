# HamNoSys Generator ‚Äî Flutter App

## üñêÔ∏è About
HamNoSys Generator is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to generate **HamNoSys (Hamburg Notation System)** symbols for sign languages. It provides an intuitive UI to let users construct and visualize HamNoSys sequences step-by-step, making it a valuable tool for sign language linguists, learners, and developers.

## üéØPurpose
Like how the spoken language & dialects change from country to country likewise, the problem with the sign language is that, it **DIFFERS** from country to country. <br>
**EG. The way each alphabet is showcased in French sign language differs from that being used in Turkey**

- To Create a Language-Independent Notation System
  - The goal was to design a notation system that could represent signs from any sign language in the world without being tied to a specific language like ASL or BSL.

- To Enable Detailed Phonetic Transcription of Signs
  - Similar to how spoken language has phonemes, sign language has visual-gestural components (handshapes, location, orientation, movement, facial expressions).

- To Aid in Sign Language Technology
  - A standardized notation opened the door to text-to-sign translation systems, avatar animation, sign synthesis, and sign recognition.

- To Promote Accessibility and Education
  - A formalized notation helps in creating teaching materials, dictionaries, and learning tools for both deaf and hearing communities.
